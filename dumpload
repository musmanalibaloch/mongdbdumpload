I have been through a lot of trouble so I came up with my own solution, I created this script, just set the path inside script and db name and run it, it will do the trick
```
#!/bin/bash
  
FILES= #absolute or relative path to dump directory
DB=`db` #db name
for file in $FILES
do

    name=$(basename $file)
    collection="${name%.*}"
    echo `mongoimport --db "$DB" --file "$name" --collection "$collection"`

done
```
